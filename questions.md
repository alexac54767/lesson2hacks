<h2>1. What are some of the best practices for creating effective wire-frames in computer science? How do wire-frames help with the design process?</h2>
<p>A way to create an effective wire-frame is to stay focused on the user-interface (how the website looks/interacts with the user). Wire-frames help with the design process since they are quick to make and allow for lots of revision and planning. Wire-frames help keep the programmer's ideas organized.</p>
<h2>2. How does user testing play a role in the design of user interfaces and wire-frames in computer science? Can you provide an example of a project where user testing significantly impacted the final product design?</h2>
<p>User testing allows designers/programmers to experience their product as a user. They can discover issues or room for improvement that they wouldn't have otherwise thought of. That way, they can improve and refine their product. One example of a project where user testing significantly impacted the final product was the HP computer that detected faces. HP had a lack of testing which led to a huge mistake. The computer recognized with lighter skin colors but not people who have more melanin. Once the prodect was used/tested by people of color, HP realized this grave mistake.</p>

<h2>1. What are examples of selection, iteration, and sequencing in the snake game?</h2>
<p>The sake game uses selection with multiple "if" statements. For example, resetting the new high score when the new score exeeds the previous record. The game also uses iteration with its for loop that checks it the snake has exeeded the board (snake occupies less space that body length)</p>
<h2>2. How does ":root" contribute to the customization of the game?</h2>
<p>Styling values can be set with the CSS elecment ":root". This element is used for determining the colors across the board, such as the snake or apple.</p>
<h2>3. Write 2-3 sentences about how the use of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS creates the final product.</h2>
<p>HTML, Javascript, and CSS all work together to create the look of the final product. Each language has its strenghts and pros/cons, so you have to strategize based on difficulty and your familiarity with the language and syntax. For example, CSS is very easy to use for styling, so it can determine the color of the words written in the HTML text box.</p>
